This is an assignment I finished for my Intro to Artificial Intelligence Class.

I coded a minimax alpha beta algorithm that acted as a player in Othello.
This algorithm calculates the best move to make that would lead to victory.
the algorithm has two heuristics that you can choose from system arguments.
The heuristics are maximum number of possible moves as well as the number of tiles
controlled by each player.
